YOU CAN CONFIGURE ALL THE PORT SETTINGS FROM THE PORT.H FILE IN SOURCE CODE.
YOU HAVE ACCESS TO CHANGE THE PORT SETTINGS FOR ALL THE SENSORS AND DEVICES
EXCEPT LCD.


NOTE:

CRYSTAL FREQUENCY:

PLEASE USE 8MHz INTERNAL CRYSTAL.

ABOUT WATER TANK:

SINCE WATER SIMULATION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN PROTEUS SO I HAVE USED SIMPLE SWITCH
FOR UPPER AND LOWER LEVEL. YOU CAN PLACE SIMPLE DARLINGTON TRANSISTOR IN THAT 
PLACE IN YOUR MAIN CIRCUIT.


ABOUT CIRCUIT BEYOND RELAY:

IN ALL THE PLACES BEYOND RELAY YOU NEED TO PLACE AC/DC SOURCE ALONG WITH THE LOAD.

ABOUT LDR:

YOU CAN CHANGE THE POTENTIOMETER(CAN BE OF ANY VALUE BUT 10K RECOMMENDED) VALUE TO 
CONTROL OVER THE LIGHT FALLING ON LDR.
